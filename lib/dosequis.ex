  @moduledoc """

    Entity-Component-System (ECS) is a distributed and compositional architectural design pattern 
    that is mostly used in game development. It enables flexible decoupling of domain-specific behaviour, 
    which overcomes some of the drawbacks of traditional object-oriented inheritance.
    Many Elixir libs append 'ex' to the name, which would have been `ECSEx` for this lib. Since that sounds like x-x and I enjoy Mexican lager this lib became DoseEquis instead.
